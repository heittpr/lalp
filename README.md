# lalp

repo for my LALP class at [CEFET-MG Campus XI](http://www.contagem.cefetmg.br/)

---

If you're curious, *LALP* is short of Laboratório de Algoritmos e Lógica de Programação, which would translate to something like Algorithms and Programming Logic Lab. It's an introductory level class about algorithms (duh) and imperative programming.

This repo exists as a backup for some exercise solutions, and of course, for getting those sweet commits on my contribution graph amirite?
